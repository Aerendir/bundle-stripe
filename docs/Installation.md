How to install Serendipity HQ Stripe Bundle
===========================================

Step 1: Download the Bundle
---------------------------

Open a command console, enter your project directory and execute the
following command to download the latest stable version of this bundle:

```console
composer require serendipity_hq/stripe-bundle "^0@dev"
```

Note: Add `@dev` to get the last development version. This version may not be stable.

This command requires you to have Composer installed globally, as explained
in the [installation chapter](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
of the Composer documentation.

Step 2: Enable the Bundle
-------------------------

Then, enable the bundle by adding the following line in the `app/AppKernel.php`
file of your project:

```php
<?php
// app/AppKernel.php

// ...
class AppKernel extends Kernel
{
    public function registerBundles()
    {
        $bundles = array(
            // ...

            new SerendipityHQ\Bundle\StripeBundle\SHQStripeBundle(),
        );

        // ...
    }

    // ...
}
```
